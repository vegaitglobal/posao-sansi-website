    "missionText": "Mission: Atina advocates for the establishment of equal status of all members of society in the public and private sphere, through identification and the fight against gender-based marginalization, discrimination, and violence. A special focus of Atina's work is children and young people, especially those who come from vulnerable groups and do not have the same opportunities as others (children and youth without primary education and parental care). Addressing the causes of victimization and vulnerability, Atina implements activities aimed at changing patriarchal norms and promoting women's activism and leadership.",
    "visionText": "Vision: Women and girls - independent, empowered, free to choose and stand up for themselves, represent the main goal that Atina strives to achieve."
